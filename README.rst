openATTIC -- Open Source Ceph Storage Management
======================================================

openATTIC is an Open Source Ceph and storage management solution for Linux, with a
strong focus on storage management in a datacenter environment.

The various resources of a Ceph cluster can be managed and monitored from a
central web-based management interface. It is no longer necessary to be
intimately familiar with the inner workings of the individual Ceph components.
Any task can be carried out by either using openATTIC's intuitive web interface or
via the REST API.

openATTIC's documentation is hosted at `docs.openattic.org <http://docs.openattic.org>`_.
