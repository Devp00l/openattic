        Arguments passed in the URL are:

        * service_id: The id of the :class:`nagios.models.Service` instance to monitor.
        * srcidx: What to draw.

          If `service_id` points to a service that uses a check command for which one or more
          :class:`nagios.models.Graph` model instances exist, the srcidx names the ID of the
          Graph instance which is to be drawn. In this case, a single image may contain multiple
          graphs stacked on one another.

          Otherwise, the service's performance data will be regarded as an array, and srcidx points
          to the index of the value that is to be drawn. In this case, a single image only contains
          a single graph, as Multigraph support is configured using the nagios.Graph entries.

        Optionally, this view allows for a set of GET variables to be passed in order to modify
        the image's appearance:

        * start:  Beginning timestamp. Defaults to "24 hours ago".
        * end:    End timestamp. Defaults to the time when the service was last checked.
        * height: Height of the graph section (not the image itself!)
        * width:  Width of the graph section (not the image itself!)
        * bgcol:  Background color, in "rrggbb".
        * fgcol:  Foreground (text) color.
        * grcol:  Graph background color.
        * sacol:  Shade-A color (top left border).
        * sbcol:  Shade-B color (bottom right border).
        * grad:   Use color gradients (true/false).

        If the image should be rendered upon a background image, the image's path needs to be
        configured in the Nagios module's settings.
