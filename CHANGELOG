  wasn't portable and package installation should rather be performed by
  the dedicated OS tools (e.g. apt-get or yum) (OP-659)
* Installation: Fixed error in "oaconfig install" that resulted in an
  incomplete installation ("This command requires oacli to be
  configured") (OP-950)
* Monitoring: Removed hard-code path names in the openATTIC Nagios plugins,
  created distribution-specific configuration files and added configuration
  options for Nagios-specific settings (OP-842) (thanks to Eric Jackson for
  the patch)
* Installation: The Nagios plugins now use the distribution's default
  directory /var/lib/nagios on EL7 to store runtime information (as
  configured via the setting NAGIOS_STATE_DIR in
  /etc/(default|sysconfig)/openattic) instead of /var/lib/nagios3 (which is
  the default in Debian). Removed directory /var/lib/nagios3 from the
  openattic-module-nagios RPM package.
* Installation: Added missing package dependencies (bc, nagios-plugins-tcp)
  to the openattic-plugin-monitoring RPM so that the "check_openattic_*"
  Nagios plugins actually work on EL7 (OP-976, OP-977)
* Installation: The Nagios plugins now read /etc/(default|sysconfig)/openattic
  to obtain distribution-specific configuration options (esp. path names).
  This makes them more portable across distributions and resolves most the
  issues observed on EL7 and SLES12 (except for the pnp4nagios configuration,
  which still requires manual intervention on EL7) (OP-820).
* Installation: added tmpfiles.d/openattic.conf to the RPM package to
  re-create /var/lock/openattic after a reboot (OP-738)
* Installation: Added missing pnp4nagios config files to openattic-module-
  nagios RPM (OP-983)

  about pnp4nagios configuration (OP-981)
