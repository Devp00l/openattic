/*
 * Bootstrap 3 - Disabled dropdown links
 *
 * Bootstrap 3 has built-in visual support for disabled dropdown menu items,
 * however these are simply visual changes and don't actually impact the
 * interactivity of the element itself.
 *
 * There are two scenarios covered by JavaScript code to keep the dropdown open
 *
 *  - when clicked target is direct child of `ul.dropdown`, like dividers.
 *  - when clicked target has a `li.disabled` parent.
 *
 * Besides that, is needed to take into account that the dividers has margins
 * where the JavaScript has no action because the target area is
 * `ul.dropdown-menu` itself. This issue is fixed with this hack based in the
 * CSS `pointer-events` property.

ul.dropdown-menu > li.divider {

}

/*
 * Mimic cursor style from native .dropdown-menu > .disabled  styles,
 * since `pointer-events: none` kills the cursor state, too.

  cursor: not-allowed;
