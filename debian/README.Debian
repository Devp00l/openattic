openattic for Debian
--------------------

Installation
------------

After installing or removing module packages, be sure to run `oaconfig install`
in order to update the openATTIC configuration accordingly.

If you are installing openATTIC for the first time, you will need to run
`oaconfig install-cli` to create a basic configuration file for oacli.

If you have an already existing LVM Volume Group which you would like
openATTIC to use, run `oaconfig add-vg <vg>` in order to make it known. This
command requires oacli to work.
