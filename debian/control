Description: Comprehensive storage management system
 openATTIC is a storage management system based upon Open Source tools with
 a comprehensive user interface that allows you to create, share and backup
 storage space on demand.
 .
 It comes with an extensible API focused on modularity, so you can tailor
 your installation exactly to your needs and embed openATTIC in your existing
 data center infrastructure.
 .
 This metapackage installs the most common set of openATTIC modules along
 with the basic requirements. Those modules are:
 .
  * LVM
  * NFS
  * HTTP
  * IET (iSCSI)
  * Samba
  * Apt
  * Nagios
  * FTP
  * Cron
  * MailAliases (EMail configuration)
 .
 You can install additional modules yourself or use the openattic-full package.
