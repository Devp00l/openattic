############################

The times when storage was considered a server-based resource and every system
needed to have its own hard drives are long gone. In modern data centers central
storage systems have become ubiquitous for obvious reasons. Centrally managed
storage increases flexibility and reduces the cost for unused storage reserves.
With the introduction of a cluster or virtualization solution shared storage
becomes a necessity.

This mission-critical part of IT used to be dominated by proprietary offerings.
Even though mature open source projects may now meet practically every
requirement of a modern storage system, managing and using these tools is often
quite complex and is mostly done decentrally.

|oA| is a full-fledged central storage management system. Hardware resources
can be managed, logical storage areas can be shared and distributed and data
can be stored more efficiently and less expensively than ever before â€“ and you
can control everything from a central management interface. It is no longer
necessary to be intimately familiar with the inner workings of the individual
storage tools. Any task can be carried out by either using |oA|'s intuitive
web interface or via the REST API.
